# SQL Data Warehouse and Analytics Project 🚀
Welcome to the SQL Data Warehouse and ETL Pipeline Project! This project demonstrates the end-to-end development of an SQL-based data warehouse incorporating ETL pipelines and business intelligence (BI) analytics to generate actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering, data modeling, and analytics.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture
The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with three layers:

- **Bronze Layer** – Ingests raw data from source systems (ERP & CRM CSV files).
- **Silver Layer** – Cleanses, transforms, and normalizes data for better quality.
- **Gold Layer** – Stores business-ready data in a star schema for analytics and reporting.

## 📖 Project Scope
### 🔹 Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
- **Data Sources**: Import structured data from ERP and CRM systems.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extract, transform, and load data efficiently using SQL & Python.
- **Data Modeling**: Implement fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexing, query tuning, and efficient storage techniques.

### 📊 BI & Analytics (Data Analysis)
Develop **SQL-based** analytics to generate insights on:
- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance Trends**
- **Sales & Revenue Metrics**

These insights empower businesses with data-driven decision-making capabilities.
